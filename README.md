# Turtle-Crossing
A fun arcade-style Turtle Crossing Game built using Pythonâ€™s built-in turtle module. Help the turtle cross the road while avoiding incoming traffic. The game gets harder as you level up!

This project is a great introduction to Python GUI programming using turtle, object-oriented design, and basic game mechanics.
